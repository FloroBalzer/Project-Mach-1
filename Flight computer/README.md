# Project-Mach-1
# **Flight Computer**

## Rocket flight computer requirements:
* flexible for two stage or one stage rocket
* must have buzzer
* must have flashing LEDs to help with recovery on the ground
* must have usb programmer and possibly for accessing stored data
* 3 mosfets for rocket trigger, parachute triggering, spare
* rocket to ground telemetry link
* GPS for tracking and recovery
* runs at 3.3V logic levels(CMOS)
* 9 dof acclermoeter, gyroscope, compass. Max accleration would be 20g
* current sensing to see the amount of current going into fuses
* Mosfet must be able to supply 1.2 amps for at least 10milliseconds. Bridge wire resistance is 1.2-1.8 Ohms
* Small package of 18mm diameter by around 40mm long package to fit within the nose cone of the smallest model rockets
* Must be able to run for at least 1 hour continueously
* must be hand solderable. Perferably
* 100Hz sample rate from sensors(except GPS)
* must record data continueously for at least 3min
* 14 parameters to record: *4 characters*:{accl_x, accl_y, accl_z, gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z, compass_x, compass_y, compass_z} + *6 characters:*{pressure}+ *3 characters:*{temperature}+ *7 characters*{Longitude, latitude}+*4 characters:*{altitude}
Assuming ascii encoding, 504 bits per string for raw data. Including commas and carriage return, each reading is ~600 bits.
* Total data storage required: 600bits * 60s * 100hz * 3min = 10.8 Mbits = 10800000 bits





## Tentative Bill of Materials for rocket flight computer
* Ublox MAX-M8Q 
* Si4463 for radio
* MS5611 for altimeter
* 3 mosfets for fuses(not chosen)
* 9dof acclerometer(not chosen)
* 3.7v lipo(not chosen)
* buck converter to bring battery voltage to 3.3V(not chosen)
* [Winbond W74M64FVSSIQ/TUBE, SPI 64Mbit Flash Memory Chip, 8-Pin SOIC](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/flash-memory/1712242/)
* [MAX2659ELT+T-RF Amplifier, GPS / GNSS, 20.5 dB Gain / 0.8 dB Noise, 1575.42 MHz, 1.6 V to 3.3 V Supply, ÂµDFN-6 ](https://uk.farnell.com/maxim-integrated-products/max2659elt-t/rf-amplifier-1575-42mhz-0-8db/dp/2800966?st=max2659)
* [ B39162B3522U410 - SAW Filter, RF, 1.575 GHz, 1.574397GHz to 1.576443GHz, GPS, 6 Pins, SMD](https://uk.farnell.com/epcos/b39162b3522u410/filter-saw-rf-1575-42mhz/dp/2360869) I don't think it will work for the other constellations besides the American GPS satellites. They use slightly different frequencies, falling outside the filter's band pass.

# TODO
* put in a linear regulator
* power everything with 3.3V
* Do GPS(mostly done 24/8/19)
* Do radio
